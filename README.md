# odin-recipes 
This a training project from #The Odin Project#
I followd the text in the assignment, and copied my first recipe html file and adjusted the text to make changes.
I created images with nano banana to get a consistant feel, and aspect ratio. 
It worked well. All in all happy with the assignment.
